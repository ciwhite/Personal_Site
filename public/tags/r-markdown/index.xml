Irish COVID 19 Intertactive MapAimTo create a map that tracks the spread of COVID 19 in Ireland as the pandemic progresses. It is meant as a public educational tool and data will be collected from various sources, such as those cited in the Wiki page on COVID 19 in Ireland, and also health statistics which the HSE have recentrly started to publish on a county by county level.</description>

      <description>Prinicpal Component AnalysisI am setting up a notebook for how to run principal component analyses. PCA techniques are very useful for data exploration when the dataset is ‘wide’, there are a lot of columns for the amount of rows of datapoints. A PCA looks for correlations among the columns by searching for vectors (eigenvectors) that correlate stongly with the data in the columns (high eigenvalues). By searchinig for this eigenvectors with high eigenvalues we can hopefully reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.</description>
